The tutorial will show you how to transfer files between your computer and a remote server (and vice versa) using SCP via command line and FileZilla.  These methods will work on Windows, Mac, and Linux.Solution 1: Command LineStep 1On Windows open \u201cWindows PowerShell.\u201d On Mac or Linux, open your respective Terminal.Step 2In order to transfer your files, we are going to use SCP. SCP works the same regardless of operating system. The SCP program takes the following parameters:scp &lt;source_directory&gt; &lt;destination_directory&gt;For our purposes of transferring homework from data, we are going to use the following command:scp &lt;purdue_username&gt;@data.cs.purdue.edu:&lt;homework_directory&gt; &lt;personal_machine_directory&gt;For example, if I wanted to transfer my hw2.c file to my current directory on my PC, I would run:scp nalderto@data.cs.purdue.edu:~/cs240/hw2/hw2.c .Step 3If everything ran properly, you should be able to access your homework on your personal machine. Keep in mind that this is a\xa0copy\xa0of your homework, so any changes you make on your personal machine will not be reflected on data and vice versa. If we want to transfer a file from our personal machine to data, we would need to run SCP again, flipping the source and destination directories.For example, if I wanted to transfer my hw2.c file from my personal machine to data, I would run:scp hw2.c nalderto@data.cs.purdue.edu:~/cs240/hw2/Solution 2: FileZillaStep 1If you are not comfortable with the command line, there are several graphical user interface programs that are available which provide the same functionality. In this tutorial we are covering FileZilla, as it is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux.You can download FileZilla here.Step 2Once you have finished installing FileZilla, open it up. On the top, there should be 4 input boxes. Put in the following information:Host:\xa0sftp://data.cs.purdue.eduUsername: Purdue UsernamePassword: Purdue Career Account Password (same password used to SSH into data)Port: 22Step 3Once the appropriate information is entered, click \u201cQuickconnect\u201d. A dialog might appear about trusting the connect. Go ahead and trust the connection.Step 4You should now be connected to data!

You can use any combination of the operators explained below:WildcardsWildcards let you match any text and are represented by asterisks (*). For example, C* S* matches words starting with C or S. Together they match phrases like Computer Science or Canadian Studies, among other things.FieldsFields relate to meta-information about our articles, such as the date or author. You can use them to search only titles, for example, instead of searching the entire wiki. Search for this article with title:optimize.Available fields: title, description, content, author, category, and date.BoostsYou can use boosts to prioritize certain search terms over others. For example, foo^10 bar tells the website you\u2019re 10x more interested in the search term foo than bar. Articles containing foo would then be higher in the search results.Fuzzy MatchesFuzzy matching allows for some grace if you misspell a term or are off by a few letters. For example, foo~1 matches anything 1 letter away from foo, like boo or food. It will not match words like boot because it has a difference of two letters.Term PresenceTerm presence allows you to explicitly include or exclude phrases in your search query with the symbols + and -, respectively. For example, +foo -bar baz matches only content with foo and without bar, that also may contain baz.By default, a result comes back if any word separated by a space matches some content. This is a limitation of the code our website uses.

Check out our initiatives page to see what we\u2019re up to now!What do USB members do?That will be completely up to you! USB prides itself in being driven by student-led initiatives- if a board member has an idea and a plan, they are encouraged to take lead. Initiatives can be small or large, and members are given flexibility to be able to move from project to project if it\u2019s in their best interest.What are the responsibilities of USB members?All USB members are expected to be working on at least one initiative- this can mean being the member of an initiative team or being the lead of an initiative with heightened responsibility. Along with work on your initiatives, USB has a mandatory hour-long weekly meeting where initiative leads can report their progress and members can discuss any new ideas or suggestions.How to JoinUSB opens applications early December and keeps them open until the beginning of Spring semester. If you follow us on social media (such as our Facebook or Instagram), you\u2019ll be the first to know when it releases!What\u2019s the application process?Our interview can be split up into 2 main parts.-Our general application is released early December and stays open until the beginning of Spring semester. It is made up of personal and behavioral questions about yourself. We\u2019re not looking for the longest response (although details, if important, can definitely add to your application)- we want to see what you\u2019re passionate about. If possible, give us a specific situation that or personal experience relates to the question.-Final interview offers will be sent out within the next two weeks. After scheduling your interview, we will invite you to either an in-person or virtual interview. You will be able to sit with two interviewers and answer some more personal and behavioral questions. Again, we want to know about you- sharing personal, specific experiences will allow us to get to know you better! During the second half of your interview you will be given a \u2018situation\u2019 question where you\u2019re encouraged to share an idea or initiative you have for the CS department and how you would lead it.Traditionally, we have had a third optional event with all candidates that made it to the final round of interviews- in the past, we have invited candidates to bowl with us and have dinner. The purpose of this optional meeting is to be able to meet all candidates in a relaxed setting and to get to know you more personally. Since this event is optional, we do not use it as a definitive way to consider candidates, but it (if anything) gives an excuse to have some fun and free food!What are we looking for?USB cares about diversity. The computer science department heavily lacks diversity and we believe that the best way for a student organization to address this is to amplify and elevate the voice of minority groups in tech. We want our board to be representative of the diverse community we are trying to build.USB is also looking for passion and great ideas for the CS department. Initiatives are completely maintained and created by USB members, so we want to find individuals who truly care about the work they will do with us. We love to talk with candidates who have genuine interest or a specific experience that is driving their idea- maybe a love for teaching that has given them an idea for a mentorship initiative, or an experience in class that made them realize there was an easier way to hold PSOs.I believe in what USB is doing but do not want to become a member. Can I still make changes within the CS department?You definitely can! While USB provides existing relationships with faculty and a network of supportive members who can help start your initiative, it is by no means the only way to do so. If you have an idea for the CS department, take initiative and contact your professors, faculty members, and your peers. Conduct some research and form a plan- change can absolutely come from an individual. And USB is more than willing to help- if you feel stuck, don\u2019t hesitate to come to our scheduled office hours or send us an email about your idea and we will share any helpful resources we have!",author:"Lauren Lum"},{index:10,title:"Help Room Information",description:"Extra help for CS 193, CS 180, CS 182, CS 240",url:"/wiki/help-room",category:"tutor",date:"August 29, 2020",content:"All help room sessions are now held virtually through ZoomBelow are the times tutors are available to help:MondayTuesdayWednesdayThursday9:00am - 11:00amPrasha BoraGowri Harish11:00am - 1:00pmGowri Harish1:00pm - 3:00pmAbhishek GunasekarJasmine SinghSamantha Coe3:00pm - 5:00pmYoungsik Yoon5:00pm - 7:00pmAlice Gontijo7:00pm - 9:00pmHajera ZemyRewati ShitoleAditya SubramaniamAditya SubramaniamJacky ZhengJasmine SinghRewati ShitoleSamantha CoeHajera ZemyYoungsik YoonIn order to sign up to get help please fill out this form during one of the appropriate times: https://bit.ly/34P0emDAfter you fill out the form, a tutor will email you with their Zoom meeting link.

Students also have the opportunity to change the grade mode for some classes to Pass/No Pass. In this grade mode, your final grade will be either P (Pass) or NP (No Pass). This grade will not impact your GPA. Note that if you change a grade mode for a certain class, this class will not count toward your degree requirements even if you get a P. The amount of credits of a P/NP class, however, counts towards your overall credit rank- for example, if you\u2019re taking five classes that are each three credits and one class has the P/NP grade mode, you are still a 15 credit student. To fully understand if you can change a course to P/NP and how it will impact your progression in your degree, discuss this option more with your advisor.",author:"Lauren Lum"},{index:13,title:"Connecting to PAL3.0 on Linux",description:"Access campus-only resources from anywhere!",url:"/wiki/connect-pal3.0-linux",category:"campus, technical",date:"November 21, 2020",content:"IntroductionPAL3.0 is Purdue\u2019s wireless network.
