The tutorial will show you how to transfer files between your computer and a remote server (and vice versa) using SCP via command line and FileZilla.  These methods will work on Windows, Mac, and Linux.Solution 1: Command LineStep 1On Windows open \u201cWindows PowerShell.\u201d On Mac or Linux, open your respective Terminal.Step 2In order to transfer your files, we are going to use SCP. SCP works the same regardless of operating system. The SCP program takes the following parameters:scp &lt;source_directory&gt; &lt;destination_directory&gt;For our purposes of transferring homework from data, we are going to use the following command:scp &lt;purdue_username&gt;@data.cs.purdue.edu:&lt;homework_directory&gt; &lt;personal_machine_directory&gt;For example, if I wanted to transfer my hw2.c file to my current directory on my PC, I would run:scp nalderto@data.cs.purdue.edu:~/cs240/hw2/hw2.c .Step 3If everything ran properly, you should be able to access your homework on your personal machine. Keep in mind that this is a\xa0copy\xa0of your homework, so any changes you make on your personal machine will not be reflected on data and vice versa. If we want to transfer a file from our personal machine to data, we would need to run SCP again, flipping the source and destination directories.For example, if I wanted to transfer my hw2.c file from my personal machine to data, I would run:scp hw2.c nalderto@data.cs.purdue.edu:~/cs240/hw2/Solution 2: FileZillaStep 1If you are not comfortable with the command line, there are several graphical user interface programs that are available which provide the same functionality. In this tutorial we are covering FileZilla, as it is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux.You can download FileZilla here.Step 2Once you have finished installing FileZilla, open it up. On the top, there should be 4 input boxes. Put in the following information:  Host:\xa0sftp://data.cs.purdue.edu  Username: Purdue Username  Password: Purdue Career Account Password (same password used to SSH into data)  Port: 22Step 3Once the appropriate information is entered, click \u201cQuickconnect\u201d. A dialog might appear about trusting the connect. Go ahead and trust the connection.Step 4You should now be connected to data!

You can use any combination of the operators explained below:WildcardsWildcards let you match any text and are represented by asterisks (*). For example, C* S* matches words starting with C or S. Together they match phrases like Computer Science or Canadian Studies, among other things.FieldsFields relate to meta-information about our articles, such as the date or author. You can use them to search only titles, for example, instead of searching the entire wiki. Search for this article with title:optimize.Available fields: title, description, content, author, category, and date.BoostsYou can use boosts to prioritize certain search terms over others. For example, foo^10 bar tells the website you\u2019re 10x more interested in the search term foo than bar. Articles containing foo would then be higher in the search results.Fuzzy MatchesFuzzy matching allows for some grace if you misspell a term or are off by a few letters. For example, foo~1 matches anything 1 letter away from foo, like boo or food. It will not match words like boot because it has a difference of two letters.Term PresenceTerm presence allows you to explicitly include or exclude phrases in your search query with the symbols + and -, respectively. For example, +foo -bar baz matches only content with foo and without bar, that also may contain baz.By default, a result comes back if any word separated by a space matches some content.

Check out our initiatives page to see what we\u2019re up to now!What do USB members do?That will be completely up to you! USB prides itself in being driven by student-led initiatives- if a board member has an idea and a plan, they are encouraged to take lead. Initiatives can be small or large, and members are given flexibility to be able to move from project to project if it\u2019s in their best interest.What are the responsibilities of USB members?All USB members are expected to be working on at least one initiative- this can mean being the member of an initiative team or being the lead of an initiative with heightened responsibility. Along with work on your initiatives, USB has a mandatory hour-long weekly meeting where initiative leads can report their progress and members can discuss any new ideas or suggestions.How to JoinUSB opens applications early December and keeps them open until the beginning of Spring semester. If you follow us on social media (such as our Facebook or Instagram), you\u2019ll be the first to know when it releases!What\u2019s the application process?Our interview can be split up into 2 main parts.-Our general application is released early December and stays open until the beginning of Spring semester. It is made up of personal and behavioral questions about yourself. We\u2019re not looking for the longest response (although details, if important, can definitely add to your application)- we want to see what you\u2019re passionate about. If possible, give us a specific situation that or personal experience relates to the question.-Final interview offers will be sent out within the next two weeks. After scheduling your interview, we will invite you to either an in-person or virtual interview. You will be able to sit with two interviewers and answer some more personal and behavioral questions. Again, we want to know about you- sharing personal, specific experiences will allow us to get to know you better! During the second half of your interview you will be given a \u2018situation\u2019 question where you\u2019re encouraged to share an idea or initiative you have for the CS department and how you would lead it.Traditionally, we have had a third optional event with all candidates that made it to the final round of interviews- in the past, we have invited candidates to bowl with us and have dinner. The purpose of this optional meeting is to be able to meet all candidates in a relaxed setting and to get to know you more personally. Since this event is optional, we do not use it as a definitive way to consider candidates, but it (if anything) gives an excuse to have some fun and free food!What are we looking for?USB cares about diversity. The computer science department heavily lacks diversity and we believe that the best way for a student organization to address this is to amplify and elevate the voice of minority groups in tech. We want our board to be representative of the diverse community we are trying to build.USB is also looking for passion and great ideas for the CS department. Initiatives are completely maintained and created by USB members, so we want to find individuals who truly care about the work they will do with us. We love to talk with candidates who have genuine interest or a specific experience that is driving their idea- maybe a love for teaching that has given them an idea for a mentorship initiative, or an experience in class that made them realize there was an easier way to hold PSOs.I believe in what USB is doing but do not want to become a member. Can I still make changes within the CS department?You definitely can! While USB provides existing relationships with faculty and a network of supportive members who can help start your initiative, it is by no means the only way to do so. If you have an idea for the CS department, take initiative and contact your professors, faculty members, and your peers. Conduct some research and form a plan- change can absolutely come from an individual. And USB is more than willing to help- if you feel stuck, don\u2019t hesitate to come to our scheduled office hours or send us an email about your idea and we will share any helpful resources we have!",author:"Lauren Lum"},{index:10,title:"Contribute to the Wiki",description:"Add or edit an article on the Student Wiki",url:"/wiki/make-article",category:"campus",date:"October 28, 2020",content:"IntroductionThe Student Wiki is designed to be a source of information that is useful for the Purdue CS/DS community.

Students also have the opportunity to change the grade mode for some classes to Pass/No Pass. In this grade mode, your final grade will be either P (Pass) or NP (No Pass). This grade will not impact your GPA. Note that if you change a grade mode for a certain class, this class will not count toward your degree requirements even if you get a P. The amount of credits of a P/NP class, however, counts towards your overall credit rank- for example, if you\u2019re taking five classes that are each three credits and one class has the P/NP grade mode, you are still a 15 credit student. To fully understand if you can change a course to P/NP and how it will impact your progression in your degree, discuss this option more with your advisor.",author:"Lauren Lum"},{index:12,title:"Connecting to PAL3.0 on Linux",description:"Access campus-only resources from anywhere!",url:"/wiki/connect-pal3.0-linux",category:"campus, technical",date:"November 21, 2020",content:"IntroductionPAL3.0 is Purdue\u2019s wireless network.

Vim and Nano CustomizationFrom Lecture 2, you should have learned about how Vim enables commands by typing colon \u201c:\u201d followed by your command. However, there are some commands you don\u2019t want to have to type every time. For example, it\u2019s pretty normal to want line numbers whenever you open a file. But having to type :set number every time you run Vim kinda sucks. How can we avoid this?Your ~/.vimrc (Vim Run Control) file controls what commands will run every time Vim is invoked. You can customize it to your heart\u2019s content.You can disable this at any time within a file by typing :set nonumber within Vim, or by deleting it from your ~/.vimrc and then re-opening Vim again.As you can imagine, there are thousands of commands you can leverage in your ~/.vimrc file. For a great resource on customization, read this article.A favorite quote from that article that you should definitely adhere to is:  \u201cDon\u2019t put any lines in your vimrc that you don\u2019t understand.\u201dFor those who are using nano, here is an article about nano customization.

Think of it as a more powerful (but less friendly) finder/file explorer.Why Use Terminal?There are many benefits of using Terminal! Here are some important points:  Accessibility to programmers - with terminal, you can do important things like compile source code, access other computers, and launch programs without having to open up any other programs  Versatility + Customizability - Say you want to move all files that start with \u2018cool\u2019 and end with \u2018.gif\u2019 into a folder called \u2018cool gifs\u2019. With terminal, this is one command!  Purdue CS and terminal - Most courses will have projects/tests/homeworks that assume terminal knowledgeHow Do I Open a Terminal Window?There are lots of options for Windows and Mac computers to open a terminal window! For Windows, you can open the Command Prompt program to open a terminal window and the equivalent program on Mac is Terminal. Alternatively, there are many other programs you can download such as Git Bash, which gives you a Bash terminal with extra Git functionalities.Now What?For many, the interface of a terminal window can be confusing at first. To utilize terminal, you must type in UNIX commands. Remember that when you\u2019re moving around in terminal, you are essentially \u2018clicking\u2019 folders and files like you would in File Explorer/Finder. The way you\u2019ll be interacting with terminal is by giving it commands. Here\u2019s the basic structure of Linux commands:It\u2019ll be helpful to get comfortable with moving around with terminal before learning more difficult actions. Here\u2019s some important commands to help you get comfortable with navigating with terminal:More CommandsAs mentioned before, one of the important benefits of using terminal is that it gives you a lot of flexibility and options- that means there are way too many available commands to talk about in this article!

Checkout a project from Version Control.  This is done from the welcome screen in Intellij!Click Check out from Version Control -&gt; Git -&gt; Log in to GitHub...The URL is asking for the HTTPS clone link. You can access this link if you go to the repository you\u2019re trying to open with Intellij, click on the green \u2018Code\u2019 button on the top right, and then copying the HTTPS link.The Directory is where this project will be stored on YOUR computer.

You should see the files from your git repository on your Intellij window now. Remember, we have just cloned your git repository- all changes you make to these Intellij files will STAY on your local machine unless you push them to the central repository in Github. In other words, if you change a file from your new cloned repository on IntelliJ and save that file, you will NOT see your changes if you check your Github repository online. To learn how to commit and push your changes, move on to the next step!Step 2: Push your changes to GitHub!After you make new changes, you must commit and push them so your Github repository will be updated. You can find Intellij\u2019s Git options on the top right of the window. Depending on which IntelliJ version you have, the icons could appear differently.  Commit and push your changes.

You can think about it like Google Docs, but for code. Unlike Google Docs, though, it tracks every change you make! VCS\u2019s are used to help manage multiple developers working on the same project, among their many other benefits. There are many VCS\u2019s available for you to use, but in this article we\u2019ll be focusing on Git.Why use a VCS?There are many reasons to use a VCS, and here are just a few:  With a VCS, you can avoid losing work because of a crash or deleting a file that you didn\u2019t mean to; you can revert your code back to when it was working  Many CS classes at Purdue require knowledge of a VCS (and of these classes, most use Git)  It\u2019s the most common way to collaborate with code  Most companies will expect you to be able to use a VCS  And even if you just learn Git, the skills you learn will be transferable to other VCS\u2019s you might have to useGitTo start using git, you must first create a repository. A repository is a folder with git functionality (it has version control now). You have to initialize git so that it\u2019ll start keeping track of everything for you. Git keeps track of things in a hidden \u201c.git\u201d folder within the repository folder. Git\u2019s like a program that goes in your folder and starts tracking everything you do.This repository on your local computer will be used to track and push changes to a central repo. If you are familiar with Github, this is the central repository hosted on Github. This central repository is the place where all collaborators can push their changes to and share with others. Think of it like a folder in Google Drive, but for holding code, not documents.So how do you push the changes you made in your local repository (that lives on your own computer) to the central repository (that your collaborators can use and see)? The basic git workflow is the following:  Change all the files you want  ADD your changes  COMMIT the files you added  PUSH your commitTo clarify these terms:  Adding a file means that you want git to pay attention to that file. You\u2019re adding that file to a list to be committed- during your next commit, the files you added will be included. Once you commit, all files are un-added and you must re-add them to include them in the next commit.  Committing means that you want git to save your changes to the files you previously added. A commit represents all the changes to the added files- this means it includes edits, additions, and deletions of files. Once something\u2019s committed, you can always go back to that commit at any time in the future.  Pushing is when you push all commits that haven\u2019t already been pushed to your central repository. Pushing is what actually updates your central repository, letting your collaborators view your changes.Helpful Git Commands",author:"CS193 Team"},{index:18,title:"LaTeX Guide",description:"Learn important LaTeX commands",url:"/wiki/latex-guide",category:"technical",date:"March 26, 2021",content:"Preamble  documentclass{article} specifies the type of document that is going to be created.

The difference is that document content and formatting are written in plain text, as opposed to showing you the formatting of the document as you type it.  LaTeX is widely used in academia.  Chances are that your math exams are written in LaTeX.  This is due to LaTeX being great for mathematical expressions.  While it might be intimidating at first, once you become familiar with it, you can create fully customized professional documents even quicker than Word or Docs.Why am I learning this?Learning CS and DS is not just learning how to code.  There is a decent amount of theory and mathematics.  You will take courses like CS 182 and CS 381 that are will require you to turn in mathematical write-ups, like proofs.  Lots of statistics professors want you to type your homework, as well.  LaTeX is useful in these cases.  Also, technical research papers you might write in the future will likely be written in LaTeX.What is Overleaf?You can think of Overleaf as the equivalent of Google Docs for LaTeX.  It allows for documents to be created online and edited by multiple collaborators.Step 1: Create an Overleaf accountPurdue provides you with a free Professional Overleaf account ($30/month value).  This gives you benefits like full document history, syncing with Dropbox/Github, and unlimited collaborators per project.Be sure to use your Purdue email to receive Professional account benefitsClick here to create an Overleaf AccountStep 2: Creating your first document  Verify your account via email  Click the Project button on the top right corner  Click the \u201cCreate First Project\u201d button, and select \u201cBlank Project.\u201dStep 3: Your first compile!As you might have noticed, LaTeX has a lot in common with programming languages.  Like Java or C, LaTeX needs to be compiled before you can see changes in your document.  Change the author from your Purdue username to your full name, and click the big green \u201cRecompile\u201d button.  This should update the document that is shown to the right.  Clicking the arrow on the \u201cRecompile\u201d button gives you the option to automatically recompile between changes.  You can enable this, if you so choose.Step 4: Edit!Congrats, you\u2019ve created your first document on Overleaf! Now all you have to do is start writing.
