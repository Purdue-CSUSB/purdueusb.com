As a CS student, you can get a keyfob from the Lawson mailroom which will give you after-hours/weekend access to the Lawson building, as well as the student activities center in HAAS G072.

## Getting a New Keyfob
To get a keyfob, simply email cs-workstudy@science.purdue.edu . Here's a template that might be helpful:

> **Subject:** Lawson Keyfob
> 
> To whom it may concern,
> 
> I am a computer science student enrolled in [CS courses here]. I would like a keyfob to access the Lawson building after-hours.
> 
> Thank you, [Your name]

## Renewing an Existing Keyfob

Keyfob access expires every semester. If you don't renew your keyfob, you won't be able to get into the building or offices without renewing.

To renew your keyfob, simply email [cs-workstudy@science.purdue.edu](mailto:cs-workstudy@science.purdue.edu) again and request that your fob be renewed. In the email, tell them new CS courses you are enrolled in.
