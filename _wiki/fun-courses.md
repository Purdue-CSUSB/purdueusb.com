#### History

##### HIST 371: Society & Rock & Roll

### Grade Options
Want to take a course you’re interested in but don’t want it to count towards your GPA? Students also have the opportunity to change the grade mode for some classes to Pass/No Pass. In this grade mode, your final grade will be either P (Pass) or NP (No Pass). This grade will not impact your GPA. Note that if you change a grade mode for a certain class, this class will not count toward your degree requirements even if you get a P. The amount of credits of a P/NP class, however, counts towards your overall credit rank- for example, if you’re taking five classes that are each three credits and one class has the P/NP grade mode, you are still a 15 credit student. To fully understand if you can change a course to P/NP and how it will impact your progression in your degree, discuss this option more with your advisor.
