Hey there! 
If you’re a CS or DS major, you know the importance of personal projects, whether it’s to
amplify your resume/LinkedIn or to get a better understanding of a certain class topic. 
But what about starting a project just because you want to, because you are passionate about 
your field and want to make new contributions. Maybe you don’t like the way something is done,
so you believe you can change it for the better. Or maybe you thought, I wish something like this
existed and decided that you can make it happen? 
 
Picture this: you start that project, but you encounter obstacle after obstacle. You don’t 
have enough time to figure it out on your own, and you don’t have sufficient experience to 
practically apply concepts you’ve just learned. Or maybe, classes, work, and life gets in the way.
What should you do?
 
If you don’t already know, the Purdue Undergraduate Student Board exists to serve the 
Purdue CS/DS student community by acting as a liaison to the CS department. 
 
There’s always room for new ideas, for improvement, and that’s why we want to help! 
We’re working on a brand-new initiative, Purdue Technical Projects, so USB can actively 
sponsor your projects! Here’s the basic idea of how it’ll work: 
 
This initiative will be run throughout the semester. USB will set up a website that will 
feature existing student-created Purdue-related projects and an area where students can input 
their project ideas. There will also be a submission box for already completed projects, and 
every project will be vetted by our initiative team before it is accepted. In the first month of the 
semester, students can enter their project ideas and the support they seek, in terms of group 
size and experience. Throughout the next couple of months, groups can be finalized and they 
can start implementing their projects. At the end of the semester, we will host a panel in which 
groups can showcase their projects, with the goal of acknowledgment and widespread use 
throughout the Purdue community! 
 
We don’t want this to be another homework assignment or project for school, so USB’s 
role will be less restrictive. We’ll contact the groups, verify that progress is being made, and act 
as a point of contact. We’ll set up a discord server in which groups can communicate with each 
other as well as contact the initiative members for any questions/concerns/ideas. Even though 
it’s semester-based, if a group hasn’t finished their project, or feels that it’s not ready for the 
showcase, no worries! They can always present next semester. 
Project potentiality is exciting, especially Purdue-related projects. We all know and love 
Boilerexams (boilerexams.com), single-handedly saving our grades! There are so many things to keep track of as a
student at Purdue, luckily the multitude of Purdue apps (created by students!) makes our lives 
easier.
