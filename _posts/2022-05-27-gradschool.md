Considering Grad School at Purdue CS? If so, this blog post is just for you.

A little bit about me(or why should you listen to me...). My name is Pinaki. I am a second-semester 
Master’s student in the CS+STAT Joint Masters at Purdue. I graduated from Purdue in May 2021 with a 
Bachelor in Computer Science with specializations in Machine Intelligence, Database and Information 
Systems, and Theory. I also minored in Math and Statistics.
During my undergraduate years at Purdue, I have been a part of Association of Multicultural Computer 
Scientists(AMCS), Reach Out for Computer Science(ROCS), Global Science Partners(GSP), and of 
course Undergraduate Student Board for Computer Science(USB). I have been a part of USB, actively 
and passively, for more than three years. I have contributed to initiatives like TA Training and Virtual 
Office Hours. Advocating on behalf of students is something I enjoy doing and that is why I am here to 
help!
A key concern amongst undergrads, often echoed via student forums, here at Purdue is the lack of 
knowledge about grad school. I am here to advocate why you should consider Purdue CS for an MS 
degree, especially if you are finishing/finished your undergrad at Purdue.
What prompted me to go for an MS?
I wanted to learn about topics whose discussion was beyond the scope of the classroom; I wanted to 
augment my knowledge. Also, I enjoyed school in general and wanted to explore research.
I started applying for master's programs sometime around September 2020. I had all my decisions in by 
February-March 2021. Despite some really competitive offers, I decided to pursue my MS at Purdue 
owing to the following reasons.

1. Cost of Living for some locations was 2-3x more than that of West Lafayette
2. Teaching Assistantship: This was a big one because often MS programs do not offer 
assistantships. At Purdue, my tuition was covered, and I got a stipend once in two weeks. Taking 
a wide variety of courses at Purdue equips you with the knowledge of ‘how to run the course’. 
This also ensures constituency and quality. Keep in mind, being a GTA comes with a lot of 
responsibilities; you are in charge of the quality of the fabric of the curriculum. Also, my medical 
insurance was covered. I was essentially staff now.
3. Familiarity with the department was another one. Purdue has been my home for 4 years. Saying 
goodbye can be hard :’)
4. Influx of New Faculty (especially in AI, ML) made me stay at Purdue with the prospect of 
research collaboration
5. Purdue’s CS MS Program offers MS Degrees in many flavors: General/Vanilla, CSE 
(Computational Sciences and Engineering), CLS (Computational Life Sciences), and CS+STAT. 

This factor made me strongly consider Purdue as this kind of flexibility was not available 
everywhere.
Other than that, there is the 5 Year BS+MS combined degree program, which can help you save a year. 
This does not apply to me as I took 4 sweet years to complete my BS and then separately applied for an 
MS.
If you are at the junction of deciding on grad school, I hope these pointers would make Purdue look like 
an attractive option.
I also serve as the Undergraduate Committee Representative at the Graduate Student Board for Computer 
Science (GSB). If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. Boiler Up!
